## Education
B.S. Management Information Systems; Minor in Business Analytics | The University of Delaware (_May 2026_)								       		


## Relevant Work Experience
**Sports Science & Analytics Intern @ University of Delaware Athletics (_October 2023 - April 2024_)**
- Collected, cleaned, and analyzed sports statistics for the Division 1 football team, evaluating performance trends and forecasting outcomes against conference opponents and higher-ranked teams.
- Generated weekly reports using PivotTables and descriptive statistics to analyze practice data, tracking trends, advancements, and areas for improvement over a 4- to 6-month period.

## Projects
The projects showcased in this portfolio include work completed both in academic settings and independently. These initiatives demonstrate a strong foundation in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving, 
leveraging tools such as Python, SQL, Excel, R/Rstudio, and C#. Each project reflects my ability to collect, clean, and analyze data to derive meaningful insights, whether through coursework, internships, or 
personal initiatives.

#### 1. College Football Performance Analysis (2021-2023)
This spreadsheet analysis analyzes college football team performance data from 2021 to 2023 to uncover trends, strengths, and areas for improvement. Using a dataset of team statistics (e.g., points per game, third-down conversions, passing/rushing yards, sacks, and turnovers), I developed multiple tools to provide actionable insights for coaches, analysts, or enthusiasts: PivotTables displaying graphs and trends over the years, a performance heatmap, and a dynamic comparison tool.

This project was one of my first ones utilizing Excel outside of school and was a developing interest at the time of work. With news of the University of Delaware moving up in the Conference for all of its Division 1 teams, I was tasked with creating charts and tools that would help compare our football teams with other schools to determine our future performance.

#### 2. Neural Networks Project using Titanic.csv Dataset (2024)
This project demonstrates the application of neural networks to predict passenger survival outcomes based on the Titanic dataset. The work involves tasks such as data loading, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. Key steps include handling missing values, splitting data into training and test sets, and experimenting with various batch sizes and epoch counts to optimize model accuracy. Visualizations of training and validation accuracy, as well as loss plots, are provided to illustrate the model's learning behavior and optimization process.

While undertaking this neural network experiment, I developed a deeper interest in learning more about this new area of data analytics, particularly how machine learning models can be optimized for real-world applications, from data preprocessing techniques to fine-tuning neural network architectures for better accuracy and efficiency.
